      "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst specializing in threat modeling. Your task is to extract structured information from one or more input documents describing a system and transform it into a comprehensive and accurate JSON object representing a Data Flow Diagram (DFD).\n",
      "\n",
      "Your analysis must be meticulous. Follow these reasoning steps precisely:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Core Components**: First, perform a full scan of the document(s) to identify and list all high-level components. This includes:\n",
      "    * `project_name`, `project_version`, and `industry_context`.\n",
      "    * `external_entities`: Any user, actor, or system outside the primary application boundary.\n",
      "    * `processes`: The distinct computational components or services that handle data.\n",
      "    * `assets`: The data stores, such as databases, object storage buckets, or message queues.\n",
      "    * `trust_boundaries`: The defined boundaries separating zones of different trust levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Systematically Extract ALL Data Flows**: This is the most critical step. You must identify every single flow of data mentioned or implied in the documents. Scrutinize sections like \"Use Cases,\" \"Data Flow Diagrams,\" \"Architecture,\" and \"Technology Stack\" to find them. Create a data flow entry for each of the following interaction types:\n",
      "    * **External-to-Process**: Flows from an `external_entity` to an internal `process` (e.g., user submitting credentials, uploading a file).\n",
      "    * **Process-to-External**: Flows from an internal `process` to an `external_entity` (e.g., returning results, sending a session token).\n",
      "    * **Process-to-Asset**: Flows where a `process` reads from or writes to a data store `asset` (e.g., \"Authentication Service reads from UsersDB,\" \"Analysis process writes to ResultsDB\"). These are essential and must not be omitted.\n",
      "    * **Process-to-Process**: Flows between internal `processes` (e.g., \"API Gateway routes request to Authentication Service\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Detail and Classify Each Flow**: For every data flow you identify, you must accurately populate all its attributes: `source`, `destination`, `data_description`, `data_classification`, `protocol`, and `authentication_mechanism`.\n",
      "    * **Data Classification Rules**: Apply strict classification.\n",
      "        * **Confidential**: Use for any data that, if exposed, could harm the organization or its users. This includes, but is not limited to: credentials, session tokens (JWTs), API keys, SAML assertions, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), health information (PHI), financial data, and proprietary business logic.\n",
      "        * **Public**: Use ONLY for data that is explicitly intended for public consumption and carries no security risk if intercepted (e.g., a list of available public APIs). **Authentication-related data is never public.**\n",
      "    * If information for a field (like `protocol` or `authentication_mechanism`) is not explicitly stated, infer it from the context (e.g., a web service likely uses HTTPS, a database connection likely uses JDBC/ODBC over TLS) and make a note of this in the `assumptions` key in the metadata.\n",

      "Design Document: HealthData Insights Platform\n",
      "This document outlines the design and architecture of the HealthData Insights platform. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive overview for conducting a thorough threat modeling analysis.\n",
      "1. System Overview 🩺\n",
      "HealthData Insights is a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed for medical researchers. It allows registered research institutions to upload anonymized patient datasets, process them using built-in analysis tools, and collaborate on findings. The system prioritizes data security, integrity, and compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.\n",
      "Core functionalities:\n",
      "User and organization management.\n",
      "Secure, encrypted upload and storage of large datasets (e.g., genomic data, clinical trial results).\n",
      "A suite of data analysis tools (e.g., statistical analysis, machine learning model training).\n",
      "Collaboration features for sharing analysis results within a research organization.\n",
      "2. Key Use Cases\n",
      "UC-1: Researcher Registration & Authentication: A new Researcher from a subscribed institution registers for an account. The system verifies their institutional email. Subsequent logins are handled via a multi-factor authentication (MFA) process.\n",
      "UC-2: Data Upload: An authenticated Researcher uploads a large, anonymized dataset in CSV or JSON format from their local machine via a web interface. The data is transferred over HTTPS to the platform's ingestion service.\n",
      "UC-3: Data Processing: A Researcher initiates a data analysis job (e.g., \"Variant Calling\") on an uploaded dataset. A processing worker retrieves the data, performs the computation, and stores the results.\n",
      "UC-4: Results Viewing: A Researcher views the results of a completed analysis job through the web interface. The results are rendered as visualizations and downloadable reports.\n",
      "UC-5: Admin Role Management: An Organizational Admin (a type of Researcher) can invite or remove other researchers from their institution's account.\n",
      "3. Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)\n",
      "DFD Level 0: Context Diagram\n",
      "A single process, HealthData Insights Platform (1.0), interacts with three external entities:\n",
      "Researcher: Sends login credentials, upload data, and analysis requests. Receives session tokens and analysis results.\n",
      "Organizational Admin: Sends user management requests. Receives confirmation.\n",
      "External Identity Provider (IdP): Interacts with the platform for SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise clients.\n",
      "DFD Level 1: High-Level Process Breakdown\n",
      "Process 1.1: User Authentication:\n",
      "Input: Credentials from Researcher.\n",
      "Output: Session Token to Researcher.\n",
      "Data Store: Interacts with UsersDB.\n",
      "Process 1.2: Data Ingestion:\n",
      "Input: Anonymized Dataset from Researcher.\n",
      "Output: Dataset write confirmation.\n",
      "Data Store: Writes to RawDataBucket.\n",
      "Process 1.3: Data Analysis:\n",
      "Input: Analysis Job Request from Researcher.\n",
      "Output: Job status update.\n",
      "Data Stores: Reads from RawDataBucket, writes to ProcessedDataBucket and ResultsDB.\n",
      "Process 1.4: Results Presentation:\n",
      "Input: View Results Request from Researcher.\n",
      "Output: Formatted Results to Researcher.\n",
      "Data Store: Reads from ResultsDB.\n",
      "4. Architecture Views 🏗️\n",
      "Logical View\n",
      "The system is composed of several microservices orchestrated via an API Gateway.\n",
      "Frontend Web App: A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React that runs in the user's browser. It communicates with the backend via the API Gateway.\n",
      "API Gateway: A central entry point for all client requests. It handles routing, rate limiting, and initial authentication token validation.\n",
      "Authentication Service: Manages user registration, login, MFA, and session token generation (JWTs).\n",
      "Data Ingestion Service: Handles large file uploads, validates file formats, and places data into a temporary storage queue.\n",
      "Analysis Orchestrator Service: Manages the lifecycle of analysis jobs. It listens for new job requests, queues them, and triggers processing workers.\n",
      "Processing Workers: A pool of containerized applications that perform the actual computation. They are ephemeral and scale based on demand. They fetch data from storage, process it, and write the results back.\n",
      "Results Service: Provides endpoints for querying and retrieving processed results and metadata.\n",
      "Physical / Deployment View\n",
      "The entire platform is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) within a single region (eu-central-1), distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.\n",
      "VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): The core network boundary.\n",
      "Public Subnet: Contains the Application Load Balancer (ALB), which acts as the public-facing entry point.\n",
      "Private Subnets: Contain all backend services and databases. These services do not have public IP addresses and can only be accessed through the ALB or via internal networking.\n",
      "Compute:\n",
      "Services like the API Gateway, Authentication, Orchestrator, and Results are deployed as containers on AWS Fargate.\n",
      "Processing Workers are also run as Fargate tasks, scaled independently by an SQS queue length metric.\n",
      "Data Stores:\n",
      "UsersDB: An Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL instance (Multi-AZ).\n",
      "RawDataBucket & ProcessedDataBucket: Amazon S3 buckets with encryption at rest (SSE-S3) enabled, versioning, and strict bucket policies. Access is granted via IAM roles.\n",
      "ResultsDB: An Amazon DynamoDB table for storing analysis metadata and results.\n",
      "Networking:\n",
      "All traffic from the internet enters through the ALB, which terminates TLS (HTTPS).\n",
      "Communication between services inside the VPC is done over the internal network.\n",
      "AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is configured on the ALB to protect against common web exploits.\n",
      "5. Technology Stack 💻\n",
      "Export to Sheets\n",
      "6. Trust Boundaries & External Dependencies\n",
      "Trust Boundaries\n",
      "External User Zone -> Application Frontend: The primary trust boundary. All input from the Researcher's browser is untrusted.\n",
      "Internet -> VPC Public Subnet: Traffic entering the ALB. Protected by AWS WAF.\n",
      "VPC Public Subnet -> VPC Private Subnet: All traffic to backend services is routed from the ALB and is considered more trusted, but still requires service-to-service authentication (e.g., via IAM roles).\n",
      "Application -> Data Stores: The boundary between compute services and persistent storage. Access is controlled via strict IAM roles and database credentials.\n",
      "External Dependencies\n",
      "Third-Party Identity Provider (IdP): For enterprise customers using SSO, the platform trusts the SAML assertions provided by the customer's IdP (e.g., Azure AD, Okta). The connection and assertion signatures must be secure.\n",
      "Email Service (e.g., Amazon SES): Used for sending verification and notification emails. The platform trusts this service to deliver emails securely.\n",
      "NPM / PyPI Registries: The software supply chain for third-party libraries used in development is an external dependency.\n",
      "---\n",

    "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst specializing in threat modeling. Your task is to extract structured information from one or more input documents describing a system and transform it into a comprehensive and accurate JSON object representing a Data Flow Diagram (DFD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your analysis must be meticulous. Follow these reasoning steps precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify Core Components**: First, perform a full scan of the document(s) to identify and list all high-level components. This includes:\n",
    "    * `project_name`, `project_version`, and `industry_context`.\n",
    "    * `external_entities`: Any user, actor, or system outside the primary application boundary.\n",
    "    * `processes`: The distinct computational components or services that handle data.\n",
    "    * `assets`: The data stores, such as databases, object storage buckets, or message queues.\n",
    "    * `trust_boundaries`: The defined boundaries separating zones of different trust levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Systematically Extract ALL Data Flows**: This is the most critical step. You must identify every single flow of data mentioned or implied in the documents. Scrutinize sections like \"Use Cases,\" \"Data Flow Diagrams,\" \"Architecture,\" and \"Technology Stack\" to find them. Create a data flow entry for each of the following interaction types:\n",
    "    * **External-to-Process**: Flows from an `external_entity` to an internal `process` (e.g., user submitting credentials, uploading a file).\n",
    "    * **Process-to-External**: Flows from an internal `process` to an `external_entity` (e.g., returning results, sending a session token).\n",
    "    * **Process-to-Asset**: Flows where a `process` reads from or writes to a data store `asset` (e.g., \"Authentication Service reads from UsersDB,\" \"Analysis process writes to ResultsDB\"). These are essential and must not be omitted.\n",
    "    * **Process-to-Process**: Flows between internal `processes` (e.g., \"API Gateway routes request to Authentication Service\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Detail and Classify Each Flow**: For every data flow you identify, you must accurately populate all its attributes: `source`, `destination`, `data_description`, `data_classification`, `protocol`, and `authentication_mechanism`.\n",
    "    * **Data Classification Rules**: Apply strict classification.\n",
    "        * **Confidential**: Use for any data that, if exposed, could harm the organization or its users. This includes, but is not limited to: credentials, session tokens (JWTs), API keys, SAML assertions, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), health information (PHI), financial data, and proprietary business logic.\n",
    "        * **Public**: Use ONLY for data that is explicitly intended for public consumption and carries no security risk if intercepted (e.g., a list of available public APIs). **Authentication-related data is never public.**\n",
    "    * If information for a field (like `protocol` or `authentication_mechanism`) is not explicitly stated, infer it from the context (e.g., a web service likely uses HTTPS, a database connection likely uses JDBC/ODBC over TLS) and make a note of this in the `assumptions` key in the metadata.\n",
