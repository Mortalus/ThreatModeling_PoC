      "1. Parse the DFD JSON: Explicitly list all external_entities, processes, assets (data_stores), data_flows (as 'source to destination'), and trust_boundaries. Ensure every item is addressed.\n",
      "2. For each listed component, brainstorm applicable STRIDE threats: Consider all six categories, identifying typical risks (e.g., data flows vulnerable to T and I due to transit; processes to D and E from overload or vulns; data stores to I at rest). Generate at least one threat per category unless impossible, to achieve 5-6 per component.\n",
      "3. Make threats realistic and specific: Include attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection for tampering), consequences (e.g., data breach leading to fines), and reference DFD protocols/architecture.\n",
      "4. Avoid duplicates: Ensure no identical threats across components; vary descriptions even for similar risks.\n",
      "5. Assign impact/likelihood with justification: Base on exposure (e.g., public-facing = higher likelihood) and calculate risk_score accurately.\n",
      "6. Use only valid references from: OWASP Top 10 2021 (A01-A10 only, e.g., A03:2021 for Injection), NIST SP 800-series (e.g., 800-53, 800-63B, 800-52), CWE (e.g., CWE-89), MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1071). Limit to 1-3 per threat; do not invent invalid ones like A11.\n",
