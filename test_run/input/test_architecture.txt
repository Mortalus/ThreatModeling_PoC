    HealthData Insights Platform - System Architecture
    
    This document describes the architecture of our healthcare data platform.
    
    External Entities:
    - Patient Portal: Web interface for patients
    - Admin User: System administrators
    - External API: Third-party integrations
    
    Core Processes:
    - Web Server: Handles HTTP requests
    - Authentication Service: Manages user authentication
    - API Gateway: Routes API requests
    - Database Service: Manages data persistence
    
    Data Stores:
    - Patient Database: Stores patient records (encrypted)
    - Session Store: Manages user sessions
    - Audit Logs: Security audit trail
    
    Key Data Flows:
    - Patient Portal sends login credentials to Web Server over HTTPS
    - Web Server queries Patient Database using TLS
    - API Gateway logs all requests to Audit Logs
